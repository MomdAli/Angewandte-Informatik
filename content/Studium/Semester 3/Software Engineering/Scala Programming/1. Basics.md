## Expressions:
```scala
2 + 2 // 4
println(1) // 1
println(1 + 1) // 2
println("Hello!") // Hello!
println("Hello," + " world!") // Hello, world!
```

## Values
```scala
val x = 1 + 1
println(x) // 2
```

You can define any variable with the keyword `val`. Unlike the keyword `var`, val are immutable variables, meaning they cannot be changed during runtime. It is recommended to use val.

```scala
x = 3 // This does not compile
```

You can also assign the type of the value:
```scala 
val x: Int = 1 + 1
```
Notice how the type declaration **`Int`** comes after the identifier **`x`**. You also need a **`:`**


## Blocks
You can combine expression by surrounding them with **`{}`**. We call this a block.
```scala
println({
	val x = 1 + 1
	x + 1
}) // 3
```

## Functions
You can define an anonymous function (i.e., a function that has no name) that returns a given integer plus one:
```scala
(x: Int) => x + 1
```
On the left of `=>` is a list of parameters. On the right is an expression involving the parameters.

You can also name the functions:
```scala
val addOne = (x: int) => x + 1
println(addOne(1)) // 2
```

 
A function can have multiple parameters:
```scala
val add = (x: Int, y: Int) => x + y
pritnln(add(1, 2)) // 3
```

Or it can have no parameters at all:
```scala
val getTheAnswer = () => 42
println(getTheAnswer()) // 42
```

## Methods
Methods look and behave very similar to functions, but there are a few key differences between them.

Methods are defined with the `def` keyword. `def` is followed by a name, parameter list(s), a return type, and a body:
```scala
def add(x: Int, y: Int): Int = x + y
println(add(1, 2)) // 3
```

Notice how the return type **`Int`** is declared after the parameter list and a **`:`**

A method can take multiple parameter lists:
```scala
def addThenMultiply(x: Int, y: Int)(multiplier: Int): Int = (x + y) * multiplier
println(addThenMultiply(1, 2)(3)) // 9
```
Or no parameter lists at all:
```scala
def name: String = System.getProperty("User.name")
println("Hello" + name + "!")
```

There are some differences, but for now, you can think of methods as something similar to functions. Methods can have multi-line expressions as well:
```scala
def getSquareString(input: Double): String = 
	val square = input * input
	square.toString

println(getSquareString(2.5)) // 6.25
```

The last expression in the body is the method's return value. (Scala does have a *return* keyword, but it is rarely used.)

## Classes
You can define classes with the **`class`** keyword, followed by its name and constructor parameters:
```scala
class Greeter(prefix: String, suffix: String):
	def greet(name: String): Unit = 
	println(prefix + name + suffix)
```
The return type of the method *greet* is **Unit**, which signifies that there is nothing meaningful to return. It is used similarly to **void** in Java and C. (A difference is that, because every Scala expression must have some value, there is actually a singleton value of type Unit, written, that carries no information.)

In Scala 2 you can make an instance of a class with the `new` keyword. In Scala 3, however, the `new` keyword is not needed thanks to [universal apply methods](https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/reference/other-new-features/creator-applications.html):
```scala
val greeter = Greeter("Hello, ", "!")
greeter.greet("Scala developer!") // Hello, Scala developer!
```

We will cover classes in depth [[3. Classes|later]].
## Case Classes
Scala has a special type of class called a "case" class. By default, instances of case classes are immutable, and they are compared by value (unlike classes, whose instances are compared by references). This makes them additionally useful for <font color="#e97144">pattern matching</font>.

You can define case classes with the **`case class`** keywords:
```scala
case class Point(x: Int, y: Int)
```

You can instantiate case classes without the **`new`** keyword:
```scala
val point = Point(1, 2)
val anotherPoint = Point(3, 4)
```

Instances of case classes are compared by <font color="#71e9ac">value</font>, not by <font color="#3b93d8">reference</font>:
```scala
if point == anotherPoint then
	println(s"$point and $anotherPoint are the same.")
else
	println(s"$point and $anotherPoint are different.)
// ==> Point(1, 2) and Point(3, 4) are different.
```
There is a lot more to case classes that we would like to introduce, and we are convinced you will fall in love with them! We will cover them in depth <font color="#e97144">later</font>.

## Objects
Objects are single instances of their own definitions. You can think of them as singletons of their own classes.
You can define objects with the **`object`** keyword:
```scala
object IdFactory:
	private var counter = 0
	def create(): Int = 
		counter += 1
		counter
```

You can access an object by referring to its name:
```scala
val newId: Int = IdFactory.create()
pritnln(newId) // 1
val newerId: Int = IdFactory.create()
println(newerId) // 2
```

We will cover objects in depth <font color="#e97144">later</font>.

## Traits
Traits are abstract data types containing certain fields and methods. In Scala inheritance, a class can only extend one another class, but it can extend multiple traits.

You can define traits with the **`trait`** keyword:

```scala
trait Greeter:
	def greet(name: String): Unit
```

Traits can also have default implementation:

```scala
trait Greeter:
	def greet(name: String): Unit = 
	println("Hello, " + name + "!")
```

You can extend traits with the extends **`extends`** keyword and override an implementation with the **`override`** keyword:

```scala
class DefaultGreeter extends Greeter

class CustomizableGreeter(prefix: String, postfix: String) extends Greeter:
	override def greet(name: String): Unit =
	println(prefix + name + postfix)

val greeter = DefaultGreeter()
greeter.greet("Scala developer") // Hello, Scala developer

val customGreeter = CustomizableGreeter("How are you ", "?")
customGreeter.greet("Scala developer") // How are you, Scala developer?
``` 
Here, **`DefaultGreeter`** extends only one single trait, but it could extend multiple traits.
We will cover traits in depth [[4. Traits|later]].

## Program Entry Point
The main method is the entry point of a Scala program. The Java Virtual Machine requires a main method, named **`main`**, that takes one argument: an array of strings.

```scala
@main def hello() = println("Hello, Scala developer!")
```
