In Scala, all values have a type, including numerical values and functions. The diagram below illustrates a subset of the type hierarchy.
![Scala Type Hierarchy](https://docs.scala-lang.org/resources/images/tour/unified-types-diagram.svg)
## Scala Type Hierarchy
[`Any`](https://www.scala-lang.org/api/2.12.1/scala/Any.html) is the supertype of all types, also called the top type. It defines certain universal methods such as `equals`, `hashCode`, and `toString`. `Any` has two direct subclasses: `AnyVal` and `AnyRef`.

`AnyVal` represents value types. There are nine predefined value types and they are non-nullable: `Double`, `Float`, `Long`, `Int`, `Short`, `Byte`, `Char`, `Unit`, and `Boolean`. `Unit` is a value type which carries no meaningful information. There is exactly one instance of `Unit` which can be declared literally like so: `()`. All functions must return something so sometimes `Unit` is a useful return type.

`AnyRef` represents reference types. All non-value types are defined as reference types. Every user-defined type in Scala is a subtype of `AnyRef`. If Scala is used in the context of a Java runtime environment, `AnyRef` corresponds to `java.lang.Object`.

Here is an example that demonstrates that strings, integers, characters, boolean values, and functions are all of type `Any` just like every other object:
```scala
val list: List[Any] = List(
	"a string",
	732,  // an integer
	'c',  // a character
	true, // a boolean value
	() = > "an anonymous function returning a string"
)

list.foreach(element => println(element))
```

It defines a value `list` of type `List[Any]`. The list is initialized with elements of various types, but each is an instance of `scala.Any`, so you can add them to the list.

Here is the output of the program:
```ansi
a string
732
c
true
<function>
```

## Type Casting
Value types can be cast in the following way:

![Type Casting|700](https://docs.scala-lang.org/resources/images/tour/type-casting-diagram.svg)

For example:
```scala
val x: Long = 987654321
val y: Float = x.toFloat // 9.8765434E8 (note that some precision is lost in this case)

val face: Char = '☺'
val number: Int = face // 9786
```

Casting is unidirectional. This will not compile:
```scala
val x: Long = 987654321
val y: Float = x.toFloat // 98765434E8
val z: Long = y // Does not conform
```
You can also cast a reference type to a subtype. This will be covered later on.

## Nothing and Null
**`Nothing`** is a subtype of all types, also called the bottom type. There is no value that has type **`Nothing`**. A common use is to signal non-termination such as thrown exception, program exit, or an infinite loop (i.e, it is the type of an expression which does not evaluate to a value, or a method that does not return normally).

**`Null`** is a subtype of all reference types (i.e any subtype of AnyRef). It has a single value identified by the keyword literal **`null`**. **`Null`** is provided mostly for interoperability with other JVM language and should almost never be used in Scala code. We'll cover alternatives to `null` later on.
